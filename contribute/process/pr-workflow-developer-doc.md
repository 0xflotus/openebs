# Improve Developer Documentation

This document describes the process for improving developer documentation by creating PRs.

Developer documentation is available under the folder: [openebs/contribute](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/tree/master/contribute)

The developer documenation includes anything that will help community like:
- Architecture and Design documentation
- Technical or Research Notes
- FAQ
- Process Documentation 
- Generic / Miscellaneous Notes

At a very high level, the process to contribute and improve is pretty simple:
- Sumit an Issue describing your proposed change
- Create your development branch
- Commit your changes
- Submit your Pull Request

The following sections describe some guidelines that can come in handy with the above process. 
*Followed by the guidelines, is a cheat sheet with frequently used git commands.*

## Submit an Issue describing your proposed change.

Some general guidelines when submitting issues for developer documentation:
- If the proposed change requires an update to the existing page, please provide a link to the page in the issue. 

You can also help with some existing issues under this category available at [developer documentation issues list](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/labels/documentation%2Fdevel)

## Create your development branch. 

- Fork the openebs repository and if you had previously forked, rebase with master to fetch latest changes
- Create a new development branch in your forked repository with the following naming convention: *"task description-#issue"*

  Example:
     This change is being developed with the branch named : OpenEBS-DevDoc-PR-Workflow-#213

## Commit your changes
- Reference the issue number along with a brief description in your commits
- Set your commit.template to the `commit_template` file with `git config --local commit.template commit_template`

## Submit a Pull request. 
- Rebase your development branch 
- Submit the PR from the development branch to the openebs/openebs:master
- Incorporate review comments, if any, in the development branch. 
- Once the PR is accepted, close the branch.
- After the PR is merged the development branch in the forked repository can be deleted.
